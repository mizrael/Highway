## Description
Highway is a distributed saga management library, written in C# with .NET Core 5. 
It is intended to be reliable, fast, easy to use, configurable and extensible.

### Message Transport
Only RabbitMQ and In-memory transport are available for now.

### State Persistence
Saga state persistence is available on MongoDB and in-memory only.

## Samples
A .NET Console app is available in the `/samples/` folder. Before running it, make sure to spin-up the required infrastructure using the provided docker-compose configuration.

## Roadmap
- add more logging
- add Azure ServiceBus message transport
- add CosmosDB saga state persistence
